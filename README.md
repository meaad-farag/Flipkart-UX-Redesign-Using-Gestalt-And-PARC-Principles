# Flipkart UX Redesign Using Gestalt & PARC Principles

This project presents a detailed UX analysis and redesign of the Flipkart website based on **Gestalt principles** and **PARC design principles**.  
The goal of this project is to identify design issues affecting usability and provide improved layouts that enhance clarity, visual hierarchy, and overall user experience.

This is an **individual project** completed by **Meaad Farag Bayuosef** for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course (SE207) at Maltepe University.

##  Project Overview

The Flipkart website was examined to identify design violations related to:

### **Gestalt Principles**
- Similarity  
- Proximity  
- Symmetry  
- Continuity  
- Closure  
- Common Fate  
- Figure & Ground  

### **PARC Principles**
- Proximity  
- Alignment  
- Repetition  
- Contrast  

Multiple issues were found, including unclear visual grouping, low contrast, misalignment, lack of symmetry, and inconsistent visual patterns.  
Each issue was analyzed and redesigned to create a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
